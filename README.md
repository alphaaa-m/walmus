## Architecture

### Standalone Page Support

The application supports two access modes:

- **Home Page Mode**: When accessed from the home page, users have full navigation access to all divisions
- **Standalone Mode**: When a page is accessed via direct link, it operates in isolation with no access to other pages

This allows pages to be shared independently while maintaining full functionality when navigated from the home page.

### Division Page Structure

Each division page follows a consistent structure:

- Business Overview
- Products or Services
- Target Customers
- Team & Operations
- Future Expansion Plans

### Navigation

Each division page includes section-based navigation that smoothly scrolls to respective sections on the page.

## Business Information

**Disclaimer:** WalMus Group is an early-stage business group. Individual divisions operate independently under dedicated teams.
